# Enron Project

## Overview
This repository hosts the code and data for Project III - Analysis of the ENRON dataset. It includes scripts for processing the ENRON emails, Jupyter notebooks for analysis, and the processed data files.

## Repository Structure

To maintain the organization and ensure ease of navigation, the repository is structured into specific directories as outlined below. Users and contributors are encouraged to adhere to this structure for consistency.

### `data`
This directory contains the processed data files in CSV format. These files are generated from the ENRON dataset and are used for analysis. Ensure that any new data files are stored here.

### `jupyterNotebooks`
All important Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks related to data analysis and processing are stored in this directory. It serves as a central location for the analytical codebase.

### `maildir`
This directory houses the raw mail data from the ENRON dataset. Due to the large size of these files, they are not included in the repository and should be obtained separately. The `maildir` directory is structured according to the individuals in the ENRON dataset, with each person having their own subdirectory.
